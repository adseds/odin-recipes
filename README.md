# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction
This is a project from The Odin Project aimed at building a recipe website using **HTML**. The primary goal is to practice creating the structure of a website, organizing content, and making it easy to navigate. 

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my understanding of basic **HTML** and how to use it to build a simple, static web page.

## Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I will demonstrate the following HTML skills:
- Structuring web pages using **HTML5** elements like `header`, `nav`, `section`, `footer`, and more.
- Creating lists to display recipes and ingredients.
- Using `images`, `links`, and `forms` to make the page interactive and functional.
- Ensuring a clean layout with proper use of headings, paragraphs, and divs.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to:
- **Build a static recipe website**: Create a layout with recipes, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Use semantic HTML**: Ensure that the website structure is clean and well-organized for accessibility and SEO.
- **Simple, Clean Design**: Keep the design basic, focusing primarily on content and structure.

## Reflection (Self-Reflection at the End)
At the end of the project, I will reflect on:
- How I structured the web page and organized content.
- The challenges I encountered while working with HTML.
- The skills I gained and how they apply to future web development projects.
